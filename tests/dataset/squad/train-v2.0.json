They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl's Tyme, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston. After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyonc\u00e9 later said the song they performed was not good. In 1995 Beyonc\u00e9's father resigned from his job to manage the group. The move reduced Beyonc\u00e9's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments. Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups. The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company. This put further strain on the family, and Beyonc\u00e9's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group.

Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"'s success in the US helped Beyonc\u00e9 attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s.

Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy Rothschild banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite). By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite, and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz.

Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt and Hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil Adolphe Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan's teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven's 7th symphony. Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's Hexameron; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme.

They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \"a perfect musician\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1.

Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 \u00c9tudes, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\". Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who was the host of the gathering where Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric was introduced to George Sand?", "id": "56cc06496d243a140015ee5a", "answers": [{"text": "Marie d'Agoult", "answer_start": 30}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric label the place in which he placed Maria and her mother's letters about the unlikely marriage?", "id": "56cc06496d243a140015ee5d", "answers": [{"text": "My tragedy", "answer_start": 713}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did George Sand write to when admitting having a strong affection for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric?", "id": "56cc06496d243a140015ee5e", "answers": [{"text": "Grzyma\u0142a", "answer_start": 747}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name of the author Chopin met at a gathering put on by Marie d'Agoult?", "id": "56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8b", "answers": [{"text": "George Sand", "answer_start": 75}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was a possible reason for Chopin's failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska?", "id": "56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8e", "answers": [{"text": "his poor health", "answer_start": 503}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Chopin write on the box of letters from Maria and her mother?", "id": "56cfdc7f234ae51400d9bf8f", "answers": [{"text": "My tragedy", "answer_start": 713}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who hosted the party whre Chopin met George Sand?", "id": "56d3234159d6e41400146288", "answers": [{"text": "Marie d'Agoult", "answer_start": 30}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What year did Maria Wodzi\u0144ska's mother tell Chopin that he likely would not marry her daughter?", "id": "56d3234159d6e41400146289", "answers": [{"text": "1837", "answer_start": 327}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Chopin write on the package that contained letters from Maria and her mother?", "id": "56d3234159d6e4140014628b", "answers": [{"text": "My tragedy", "answer_start": 713}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did Sand confide to in a letter about her feelings for Chopin in June, 1838?", "id": "56d3234159d6e4140014628c", "answers": [{"text": "Grzyma\u0142a", "answer_start": 747}], "is_impossible": false}], "context": "In 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).

The Tibetans required Chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement.

Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing.

Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players \"big and clunky or small and useless\" with user interfaces that were \"unbelievably awful,\" so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey, and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive. Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, and purchased the rights to it for Apple, and had also already worked out how the screen, battery, and other key elements would work. The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams, while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang & Olufsen's BeoCom 6000 telephone. The product (\"the Walkman of the twenty-first century\" ) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23, 2001.
